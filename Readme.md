# Vagrant LAMPP

Vagrant box with Puppet Standalone provisioner. Install Apache2, MySQL, PHP and 
a couple of tools needed for PHP development.

For convenience, Puppet configures the default VHost for Apache2 to point to 
the project root directory and creates a MySQL database.

The box is using Ubuntu 12.04 Server (Precise) x64 as base box.

## Preconditions

 * Vagrant (Tested on different version 1.2.7, 1.5.1)
 * VirtualBox 

## Usage

### Adding To A Project

This is intended to be used as drop-in sub-module for an PHP development 
project. To add this box to a project, either clone it into a sub-folder of 
your project root or preferrable add it as a submodule if you are already 
using Git on the project:

````
git submodule add git@github.com:joerx/vagrant-lampp.git vagrant
```` 

The above command will create a new folder 'vagrant' inside your project 
containing the contents of this repository. The folder name 'vagrant' is not 
technically required, but recommended. 

More on Git submodules here: http://git-scm.com/book/ch6-6.html

### Folder Structure

It is required to located the contents of this repository into a folder 
directly below the project root of your web application (see below why).
   
### Environment variables

Some customization of the Vagrant box can be achieved by setting environment 
variables before booting or provisioning the box:
 * `V_SITE_NAME`: override the site name to be used (see below), otherwise the 
   name of the parent folder is used
 * `V_APT_MIRROR`: allows to use an alternative apt-mirror for performance 
   improvements. Defaults to 'archive.ubuntu.com'.
 * `V_VBGUEST_AUTO`: If (vagrant-vbguest)[https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest]
   is installed, it will automatically update VirtualBox guest additions inside
   the box. Set this to "0" to disable this (useful for testing).

## Project Assumptions

The box will set up the document root for the web servers default vhost and a 
MySQL database for the project automatically. It will do this based on an 
internal variable `SITE_NAME`. The `SITE_NAME` will be the base name of the parent 
of the folder the Vagrant file is located in. This can be overridden using the 
environment variable V_SITE_NAME.

Assuming you add this to a project called 'my_project', and given the directory 
structure below, SITE_NAME would be set to 'my_project'. 

````
.
|-- ...
`-- my_project
    |-- vagrant
    |   |-- puppet
    |   |-- README.md
    |   `-- Vagrantfile
    `-- ...
````

Based on this, the following configuration will be applied:
 * A shared folder 'my_project' --> '/var/www/my_project'
 * Folder '/var/www/my_project' as document root for Apache2
 * A MySQL database 'my_project', user 'my_project', pass 'my_project'

## Recommended Plugins

 * Use [vagrant-vbguest](https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest) to make
   sure guest additions in the box match current VirtualBox version

## Limitations

 * Cannot push to Git from inside the box as public SSL key is missing. 
   Branch, commit, etc. works though. Copy the SSH-public/private key pair 
   your are using on Github to /home/vagrant/.ssh if you want to push from 
   inside the box
